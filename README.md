            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Football, known as soccer in some countries, is governed by a set of rules designed to ensure fair play and safety. These rules, established by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), outline the regulations for how the game is played. In this essay, we will explore the fundamental rules of football, including the objectives of the game, the structure of the match, and the various regulations that players and officials must adhere to.

            <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
            <p class="rule-text">
                The primary objective of football is to score more goals than the opposing team. Each match is played over two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute halftime break. The game begins with a kickoff, and the team that scores the most goals wins. If the match ends in a draw, it may proceed to extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's rules.
            </p>
            <p class="rule-text">
                Football is played with a round ball, and players can use any part of their body except their hands and arms to control the ball. The only exception to this rule is the goalkeeper, who is allowed to use their hands within their penalty area.

            <h2>Fouls and Misconduct</h2>
            <p class="foul-text">
                Fouls and misconduct are actions that violate the rules of the game and can result in free kicks or penalties. Common fouls include tripping, pushing, and holding opponents. More severe offenses, such as violent conduct or using abusive language, can lead to yellow or red cards. A yellow card is a warning, while a red card results in the player being sent off the field and their team playing with one fewer player.

            <h2>Offside Rule</h2>
            <p class="offside-text">
                The offside rule is one of the most complex aspects of football. A player is considered offside if they are closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent when the ball is played to them. Being offside is not an offense in itself; the player must be involved in active play, such as receiving the ball or interfering with an opponent, for the rule to apply.
